converted_text = "Saying that applications share a single network connection through multiplexing is not much of an explanation. How does the TCP/IP process determine the source and destination application for the contents of an arriving segment? The answer isthrough sockets. Sockets are the combination of IP address and TCP/UDP port number. Hosts use sockets to identify TCP connections and sort out UDP two client sockets as 192.168.10.79:14972 and 192.168.10.70:14973. So the sockets allow simultaneous file transfer sessions to the same client from the same FTP server. If the client sessions were distinguished only by IP address or port number, the server would have no way of uniquely identifying the client FTP process. And the FTP serverâ€™s socket address is accessed by all of the FTP client sat the same time without confusion Now consider the server shown in Figure 13.2. Here there is a server that has more than one TCP/IP interface for network access, and thus more than one IP"
